title: getting started with this site
---
This post marks the start of my transition to using the [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) static site builder, attached to my [github](https://github.com/jmicrobe) profile. In the past I was using weebly to host my [personal site and resume](http://jessicamicrobe.weebly.com/), mostly because I was too busy learning more about coding with genetic information to be bothered with the awesome challenge of website design. I'm looking forward to sharpening my skills in front-end web development (on the side, of course) and I hope to share some of what I learn on this blog. I'm also an adventurous baker, food fermenter and composter so these things may pop up from time to time.
