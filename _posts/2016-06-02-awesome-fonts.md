title: awesome fonts

I spent a good chunk of time recently playing around with icons in [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/) with the intent of making some nicely customized buttons for the navbar on this site. I actually enjoy (and miss) graphic design projects, so this was fun (but frustrating)...

But do I feel pretty silly now that I know about little more about how to use CSS, and this awesome site [fontawesome.io](http://fontawesome.io/). Besides the fact that fonts are completely scaleable and I don't have a good grasp on making vector images, **fontawesome** is just...awesome. Free, no java needed, accessible for screen readers...the list goes on. It's a simple, super handy website. Now my navbar has nice button-like links to my various social media contacts.
I <i class="fa fa-heart" aria-hidden="true"></i> fontawesome.
