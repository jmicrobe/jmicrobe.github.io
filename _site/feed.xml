I actually enjoy (and miss) graphic design projects, so this was fun (but frustrating)…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But do I feel pretty silly now that I know about little more about how to use CSS, and this awesome site &lt;a href=&quot;http://fontawesome.io/&quot;&gt;fontawesome.io&lt;/a&gt;. Besides the fact that fonts are completely scaleable and I don’t have a good grasp on making vector images, &lt;strong&gt;fontawesome&lt;/strong&gt; is just…awesome. Free, no java needed, accessible for screen readers…the list goes on. It’s a simple, super handy website. Now my navbar has nice button-like links to my various social media contacts.
I &lt;i class=&quot;fa fa-heart&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt; fontawesome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;i class=&quot;fa fa-coffee&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i class=&quot;fa fa-steam-square&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i class=&quot;fa fa-reddit-square&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i class=&quot;fa fa-share-alt-square&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i class=&quot;fa fa-rebel&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i class=&quot;fa fa-scissors&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i class=&quot;fa fa-spinner fa-spin fa-fw&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;
