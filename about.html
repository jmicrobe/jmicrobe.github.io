  Bacteria are the major organisms on this planet â€“ in numbers, in total mass,
  in importance to the global balances. Thus, it is microbial ecology that
  matters most; it is microbial ecology that is most intimately and importantly
  connected to the earth's exterior. And it is microbial ecology that is most in
  need of development, both in terms of facts needed to understand it, and in
  terms of the framework in which to interpret them.

  I currently work as a research assistant in the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering at the University of Washington, specifically with microbial ecology. As for my day-to-day work If I were to explain like I'm five - I am a microbe farmer. This is great for me, because as an undergraduate I farmed microbes as well, domesticating ones harvested from extreme environments like alkaline hot springs and deep-sea hydrothermal vents. I even had a <a href = "http://laugeomicro2015.blogspot.com/">brief stint as a microbe hunter</a> - taking a month-long trek out to sea off the coast of Tonga, assisting in sample collection and data logging for <a href="http://www.whoi.edu/page.do?pid=8423">a really awesome underwater remotely operated robotic vehicle</a>! This experience really fueled my passion for microbial ecology, and astrobiology in particular (ie microbes in space!).

  I also recently graduated with a master's degree in Bionformatics from the University of Oregon. I had a great experience with this hands-on, internship-oriented program. You can learn more about it <a href="https://bioinformatics.uoregon.edu/">here</a>. This program helped launch my interests in programming, data science, and even learning about hardware and electronics projects! My training gave me the confidence to attend hackathons, teach biology to undergrads, and even spurred me to help organize the first ever <a href="http://portland.sciencehackday.org/">Science Hack Day in Portland, OR 2016</a>.
