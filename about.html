<div style="padding:12px;background-color:#B7D490;line-height:1.4;"><br><i>Bacteria are the major organisms on this planet â€“ in numbers, in total mass, in importance to the global balances. Thus, it is microbial ecology that matters most; it is microbial ecology that is most intimately and importantly connected to the earth's exterior. And it is microbial ecology that is most in need of development, both in terms of facts needed to understand it, and in terms of the framework in which to interpret them.</i><br>

<p>I'm currently a graduate student in Bioinformatics at the University of Oregon.
My research interests are centered around applying bioinformatic tools to analyze
microbial data from next-generation sequencing output. I received my B.S. in Micro and Molecular Biology after working for two years in an extremophile microbial ecology lab. During that time I completed an independent research thesis supported by competitive grants from both the Oregon NASA Consortium and the Ronald E. McNair Scholars Program. I also had the great opportunity of joining my lab for a month at sea, collecting deep-sea hydrothermal vent samples near Tonga in the Pacific Ocean. My work in this lab ignited my passion for extreme environments, and astrobiology in particular.
