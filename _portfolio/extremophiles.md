## Background

My first introduction to bioinformatics was during my undergraduate research thesis, and the experiences I had inspired me to pursue more computational work for my graduate studies. For my thesis I used traditional laboratory and genomic techniques to characterize a novel bacteria isolate.

This bacterium, referred to as Eh-2, was collected from the intersection of a hot spring and an alkaline lake in Ethiopia. While in the lab I was conducting growth rate studies, I also was interested in it's 16s rRNA phylogeny. Based on 75% coverage of the gene and a BLAST query, Eh-2 was only 95% similar to one other organism in culture.
